          <li>
            Designed and Programmed a robot arm which can detect human proximity
            using CTMU on PIC32 to do capacitive sensing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Programmed 3 potentiometers to control three servo motors on the
            robot arm.

          Programmed a hovering device with lift-motor which stopped at a
          designated angle with PID control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmed in ISR to do PID and with protothread to take serial
          commands from PuTTY, output to LCD and DAC.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tune the PID to gain the optimal response and set a button to
          automatically go through a series of angles.

          Programmed a game in which users got score from catching the bouncing
          balls with an ADC controlled paddle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmed the ball-ball and ball-wall collision algorithm to make
          collisions looked real.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optimized with fixed-point, macros, overclock and LUTs, so we had 350
          balls on screen at 16 frame rates without jitter.

          Made a digital sound synthesizer which can take or record keypad
          inputs and play corresponding notes or recorded sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmed the notes with attack, sustain and decay time and made
          notes ‘string like’ with FM.
