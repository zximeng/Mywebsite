      Hi! Welcome to my personal page. My name is Ximeng Zhang. You can call me Simon. I got my bachelor
      degree in ECE and a minor in Econ at Purdue. I am currently a Master of Engineering student in Cornell
      University.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I was in EE, I took classes like semiconductor, electrical motors, feedback
      system, power electronics and so on. Starting in my Senior year, I found that I was really interested in
      Embedded system design like IoT. I have done several embedded system design using different chips like
      STM32, PIC32, ATmega328p, ESP8266, etc. I also really enjoy making my own PCB. So for my senior design,
      I made a smart home control system and designed our own boards. But I found that I should continue learning
      in this area to advance my skills. So I came to Cornell for my master degree. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In my master year, I continued to work on embedded system design. I took <a
        href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/">ECE4760: Microcontroller</a>
      taught by Captain Bruce Land and start working in<a href="https://www.hybridbody.human.cornell.edu/"> Hybrid Body
        Lab</a>supervised by professor Cindy Kao. I also took
      operating system and computer vision classes which I found very helpful. For the next semester I would study more about robotics, computer network,
      machine learning and algorithms. 
      Please check out the details about me and my projects in the links below!
    </p>
    <p>
      I grow up in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China and spent most of my childhood there, then I came to U.S. Aside from 
      Shijiazhaung where I grow up,I have lived in Shanghai for a total of around half year; Beijing for half year;
      Singapore for few months; Toronto for half year; blacksburg for 2 years; West Lafayette for 2 years, and now I live in Ithaca.
      In my life, I love to travel (a lot), read books, watch movies. I have been to most U.S cities, Mexico, Canada, Bahamas,etc. Planning on
      going to Japan and Maldives.  
      My girlfriend recently accepted an offer from Microsoft at Seattle. So we would be travel around West coast more!
