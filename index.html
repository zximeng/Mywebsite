    Hi! Welcome to my personal page. My name is Ximeng Zhang. You can call me Simon. I got my bachelor
degree in ECE and a minor in Econ at Purdue. I am currently a Master of Engineering student in Cornell 
University. 
        </p>
        <p>
    Since I was in EE, I took classes like semiconductor, electrical motors, feedback 
system, power electronics and so on. Starting in my Senior year, I found that I was really interested in 
Embedded system design like IoT. I have done several embedded system design using different chips like 
STM32, PIC32, ATmega328p, ESP8266, etc. I also really enjoy making my own PCB. So for my senior design,
I made a smart home control system and designed our own boards. But I found that I should continue learning
in this area to advance my skills. So I came to Cornell for my master degree. (My girlfriend lives in Toronto
So I don't have to fly from Chicago everytime anymore.) 
        </p>
        <p>
    In my master year, I continued to work on embedded system design. I took <a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/">ECE4760: Microcontroller</a> 
taught by Captain Bruce Land and start working in<a href="https://www.hybridbody.human.cornell.edu/"> Hybrid Body Lab</a>supervised by professor Cindy Kao. I also took
operating system and computer vision classes which I found very helpful. Please check out the details about
me and my projects in the links below!

    My girlfriend accepted an offer from Microsoft at Seattle. So<strong><em> I am Actively Looking for a job in Seattle area!</em></strong></p>

    We have a beatiful siamese cat called Tiffany, feel free to check out her pictures in the link!
